## Rationale

This prompt balances brevity (497 tokens) with comprehensive instructions. I used numbered sections for clarity and precise output requirements with the exact JSON structure. The tone is set as friendly but professional, and clear rules are established for the callback flag. I avoided verbose explanations and redundant examples to keep the prompt concise, instead focusing on the precise requirements and expected behavior. The prompt establishes both what information to collect and how to format the response, ensuring consistent data extraction.

## Demo

**Customer Call Transcript:**

**AI:** Hi, this is Premium Motors calling about your recent service visit. I'd like to get your feedback if you have a moment?

**Customer:** Sure, I have a few minutes.

**AI:** Great! On a scale of 0-10, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with your recent service?

**Customer:** I'd say a 7. It was good but took longer than expected.

**AI:** Thank you. How would you rate the quality of workmanship on your vehicle?

**Customer:** That was very good, I'd give it a 9.

**AI:** Excellent. And how would you rate the timeliness of your service completion?

**Customer:** That's where I had an issue. Probably a 4 since I was told it would be ready by noon but wasn't done until 3pm.

**AI:** I understand, and I appreciate that feedback. How would you rate the friendliness of our staff?

**Customer:** The staff was great, especially Maria at the front desk. She was really helpful. 10 for sure.

**AI:** Thank you for mentioning Maria. Is there anything specific about your visit you'd like us to follow up on?

**Customer:** Yes, I'm a bit confused about what's covered under my warranty. The service advisor mentioned something but I didn't fully understand.

**AI:** Got it. Anything else you'd like to mention about your visit?

**Customer:** No, that's it. Gracias por llamar.

**AI:** De nada. Gracias por sus comentarios. ¿Hay algo más que le gustaría añadir en español?

**Customer:** No, eso es todo.

**AI:** Thank you for your time. Have a great day!

**JSON Output:**
```json
{
  "ratings": {
    "overall_satisfaction": 7,
    "workmanship_quality": 9,
    "service_timeliness": 4,
    "staff_friendliness": 10
  },
  "follow_up_items": {
    "billing_disputes": [],
    "mechanical_issues": [],
    "warranty_questions": ["General warranty coverage clarification"],
    "service_logistics": ["Service completed 3 hours later than promised"],
    "safety_concerns": []
  },
  "positive_remarks": [
    {"employee": "Maria", "comment": "at the front desk, really helpful"}
  ],
  "preferred_language": "Spanish",
  "callback_needed": true
}
```

The callback_needed flag is true because the timeliness rating was below 5 and there was a warranty question.
